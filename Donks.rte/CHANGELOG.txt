v0.1.0
- First release, contains Donk and Donk Rifle

v0.1.1
- Fixed attack flies targeting doors when they couldn't harm them anyways
- Fixed attack fly sound being way too loud
- Fixed spark bullets not hitting very close targets
- Slightly tweaked spark bullet trail to result in fewer wacky results
- When a Donk dies with active flies, it will now (attempt to) transfer them to a nearby Donk, flies that fail to transfer will pop
- Reduced blue fly attack rate a bit (2.5/s --> 2/s)
