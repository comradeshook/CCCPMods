- Hailstorm doesn't work
- Sniper might be too weak
- Napalm grenade is LAME
- Destroyer can friendly fire

- Liquidus has big terrain delete circle; keeping until people bitch about it


Reduced terrain chew of a lot of things
Rocket thruster is STRONKER and also rocket ignores its cargo weight
Orbital teleport no longer deletes terrain
Added extra frames to Planet Killer, and also its initial explosion animation looks much cooler
More smoke in Destroyer projectile trails because it's cool, also Destroyer ammo difference now works via different magazines
Removed deepcheck from all magazines and casings and also made their material much weaker so they don't form blockades
SMG, Pistol, Plasma Axe and Mortar Caller are properly dual-wieldable now so the off-hand variants are removed
Shotgun, Talus and Tephra now have cool recoil
MARS walk paths are now mostly unshidded, hooray!
