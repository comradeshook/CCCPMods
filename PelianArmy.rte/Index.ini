	SupportedGameVersion = 6.2.2
	Description = Although these guys hail from the planet Pelik, they are very much human. Well, the soldiers are. The robots aren't. The faction as a whole is both powerful and very durable, with armor capable of withstanding dozens of direct hits and weaponry ranging from simple pistols through plasma rifles and all the way up to the massive singularity cannon. The biggest problem? These guys don't come cheap.
