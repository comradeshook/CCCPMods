While i'm not going to use any particular type of license, i will
go as far as telling you what you can and what you can't do with
my mod.

- You can use it as much as you damn well please.

- You can distribute it yourself, as long as you give credits and such. 
It would be preferred if you just pointed people to the thread that contains
the mod, however.

- You can freely modify it for personal use, but you must ask for my
permission if you want to distribute any modifications publically.

- You can use any part of the mod as a base for your own mod, IF! you
have received my permission. Don't worry, i'm pretty liberal about it,
so really, don't be afraid to ask. It's much better than risking your
ass with plagiarism, of which i have next to no tolerance for.

- You can NOT pass this mod off as your own creation AT ALL.

- If there's something you wouldn't want to happen to a mod of your
own, chances are that i won't want it with my mod.

If you're in doubt about something, just ask me.
